## Population genomics of _Centurus santacruzi_ Complex

**This repository includes the following directories and files:**  
**_bin_**: contains four scripts and a parameter configuration file to run ipyrad;    
**_data_**: contains the directory *res_ipyrad*, which includes the ipyrad run (specified with the parameter configuration file and the script from bin) outputs, which constitute the input file for the subsequent analyses;      
**_meta_**: contains metadata of sequenced individuals and a text file with name of samples with more than 30% of missing data (needed to run the filtering individuals option of vcftools).  
  
The _scripts_ contained in *bin* allow to complete the workflow represented in the following figure:

**[_run_trimmomatic.sh_](https://github.com/AlexLlanesQuevedo/santacruzi_project/blob/master/bin/2-run_trimmomatic.sh)** runs a loop for executing trimmomatic on raw samples, specifically the function slidingwindow. Slidingwindow starts scanning at the 5Â´ end and clips the readonce the average quality within the window (4 bp) falls below a quality threshold (20). **Raw data is not included in the repository, so this script cannot be executed.**   
**_run_ipyrad.sh_** runs ipyrad, an interactive assembly and analysis toolkit for restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-seq) and related data types. Configuration parameters are specified in *params-run_w_refgen.txt*. **Clean data is not included in the repository, so this script cannot be executed.**   
**_run_vcftools.sh_** for filtering individuals and SNPs sites containing a maximun of 30% of missing data and write in a new vcf file; as well as calculating allele frequency, HWE statistics and inbreeding coefficient.**run first.**    
**_run_plink.sh_** runs a basic command for converting .vcf format to .plink. **run once vcftools instructions are completed.**    
**_PCA-Structure.R_** contains a script for performing Principal Components and Structure-like Analyses, as well as a test of outlier loci in the sample.**run when plink and vcftools outputs have been obtained.**
