## Population genomics of _Centurus santacruzi_ Complex

**Three directories are included in this repository:**  
**_bin_**: contains four scripts and a parameter configuration file to run ipyrad  
**_data_**: contains the directories *raw* (with "raw" sequence data of each sample), *clean* (with "clean" sequence data after trimming with Trimmomatic), *refgen* (containing the reference genome of _Centurus aurifrons_, the sister species), and *ipyrad_runs* (containing ipyrad run outputs, which constitute the input file fon the subsequent analyses)  
**_meta_**: contains metadata of sequenced individuals 
  
The _scripts_ contained in *bin* allow to complete the workflow represented in the following figure:

**_run_trimmomatic.sh_** runs a loop for executing trimmomatic on raw samples, specifically the function slidingwindow. Slidingwindow starts scanning at the 5â€Ÿ end and clips the readonce the average quality within the window (4) falls below a quality threshold (20)    
**_run_ipyrad.sh_** runs ipyrad, an interactive assembly and analysis toolkit for restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-seq) and related data types. Configuration parameters are specified in *params-run_w_refgen.txt*   
**_run_vcftools.sh_** for filtering individuals and SNPs sites containing a maximun of 30% of missing data and write in a new vcf file; as well as calculating allele frequency, HWE statistics and inbreeding coefficient.  
**_run_plink.sh_** runs a basic command for converting .vcf format to .plink
